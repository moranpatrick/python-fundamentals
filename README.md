# Python Fundamentals Problem Sheet

## Instructions - Install Python
Step 1 - Download Anaconda 3 from their website [here.](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  
Step 2: Choose a Text editor of your choice. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Instructions - Running the python Files
Step 1 - If your using VS Code open the Command Terminal by pressing Ctrl + '.  
Step 2 - Run each script by typing into the command terminal the following.  
> python name_of_file.py  

So to run the first problem simply type:  
> python hello.py  

The program will execute on the command line.  

Step 3 - If the text editor your using does not have a command terminal simply open your command prompt, change directory to where the python scripts are located and repeat step 2.
